# DandyCrochet
This repository is for my Dandy Crochet Store (for Android mobile)

This Android web app was created with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Angular framework and Cordova. 
It is my first mobile application project and it functions as a very simple e-commerce store.

Directions on how to use:

First things first, download the zip file and unzip it.

This is the directory path to the apk file: C:\Users\ogida\OneDrive\Desktop\SecondSemCourses\2430-MobileApps\dandy-crochet\mobile\platforms\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

Before running it, run in the project terminal: npm install to install the node_modules.

Follow the rest once the app is able to run.

When the home page appears, click on any of the product pictures to take you to the product detail page. 

Select the size and quantity desired then click the Add to Cart button which redirects you to the Cart page.

The Cart page shows all the products that have been added.

The size and quantity of the products can be updated using the Modify button and they can also be removed from the cart using the Delete button.

There is a Checkout button at the end of the page which redirects you to the Checkout page where you enter your customer infomation and card details.

After entering the card details, clicking the Place Order button takes you to the Order details.

This project was my final Project for my second year second semester in college so it may appear unrefined as I had to rush it a bit to meet up with the deadline.
